        <b>Here is my story!</b>
        <ul>
            <li>4 years ago I discovered Polymer and Web components spec. I was not impressed at all because at the time we had</li>
            <li>the fantastic AngularJS, we had directives, two way data binding, it was the best!</li>
            <li>And then out of the blue we needed had to migrate from AngularJS to Angular and it was painful. Though I am pretty that we all are happy with the result.</li>
            <li>But in late 2017 I discovered StencilJS and something happened in my mind... I regain confidence on Web components and this talk is about that.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Let's see the problems that StencilJS is trying to resolve</b>
