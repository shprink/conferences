        <b>Here is my story about Web Components.</b>
        <ul>
            <li>4 years ago I discovered Polymer and Web components. I was not impressed at all because at the time we had</li>
            <li>AngularJS, we had directives, Sass etc. all the tools needed to make great applications</li>
            <li>And then as everybody else in this room I had to migrate to Angular and I am pretty happy with with Angular so far</li>
            <li>But in late 2017 I discovered StencilJS and something happened... I regain confidence on Web components and this talk is about that.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Let's see the problems that StencilJS is trying to resolve</b>
